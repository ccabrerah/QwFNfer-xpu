# QwFNfer-xpu

A heavily optimized build of [QwFNfer](https://github.com/Apolog1ze-Dev/QwFNfer), the purpose-built
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next inference engine, for the **Intel Arc Pro B70** (32 GB, Battlemage) through ggml's SYCL
backend. The engine is upstream's; this fork adds a ggml-sycl patch series tuned for the card
(`patches/ggml-sycl/`), engine changes for the B70's memory layout and launch costs, a dense-weight overlay, and a
measured run configuration. Everything else (the three-tier expert cache, the sparse attention, the server
and its OpenAI and Anthropic APIs) works as upstream documents it.

## Major improvements

Against the first B70 enablement (2026-09-15: stock llama.cpp SYCL backend, Unsloth UD-Q3_K_XL, no switches):
**15-16 tok/s warm chat and 222-248 tok/s prefill at 21K**. Now, with the validated run configuration below, at a
110 W power cap: **29-31 tok/s short-prompt decode, 27 tok/s decode at 40K context, 430-450 tok/s prefill at
20-40K, ~386 tok/s at 89K**.

| Change | Where | Measured effect |
|---|---|---|
| q2_0 experts stored as [codes][scales] so the MoE kernel uses aligned vector loads | patch 09 + engine (`QWFN_Q2_SOA`) | decode layer graphs -18%, 40K decode +20% |
| wide-load bf16/f16 one-token matvec (16-byte loads, f32 accumulate) | patch 05 (`GGML_SYCL_MMVW`) | decode +23% |
| one-token sparse attention fused into one kernel over the q8_0 cache | patch 10 (`GGML_SYCL_FUSE_SPARSE_DECODE`) | decode layer graphs -8.5% |
| small-K f32 matmul without oneMKL's per-call host cost | patch 05 (`GGML_SYCL_SMALLK`) | decode layer graphs -4.9% |
| wide q2_0 MoE matvec + fused gate/up/SwiGLU | patches 07-08 (`GGML_SYCL_MOE_Q2W`) | decode layer graphs -4% |
| hyper-connection combine + norm (and its gate) as one kernel | patches 04, 06, 11 | decode layer graphs -2.3%; with the device-built inputs, 89K prefill -14% |
| small-kernel fusions: router top-k, hyper-connection mixer, ADD chains, MoE weighted sum, DeltaNet conv | patches 12-15 | decode layer graphs -8% (~300 fewer kernels per token), decode ~+5% |
| the prefill sparse-attention indexer's per-head score sum as one kernel | patch 16 (`GGML_SYCL_FUSE_IDX`) | attention -10% at 89K (78 -> 70 s), -1.8 s at 40K; bit-identical |
| OpenMP pool stops spinning next to the launch thread | `KMP_BLOCKTIME=0` | decode +5% |
| next-layer expert prediction from the FFN input | engine (`QWFN_PREDICT_CUR2`) | decode +4.7% |
| oneDNN flash attention for prefill | `GGML_SYCL_FA_ONEDNN` | 89K prefill 90-192 -> ~300 tok/s |
| causal mask and sparse-attention bias built on the device | engine (`QWFN_DEV_MASK`, `QWFN_QSA_PACK`) | 89K prefill 361 -> 389 tok/s |
| locked, driver-registered host memory for the RAM tier and prefill staging | engine (`QWFN_LOCK_HOST`) | 89K prefill 425 -> 482 tok/s |
| fix: the prefill's sparse-attention selection no longer spends its slots on blocks after the query (backend-neutral; offered upstream) | engine | usable cells per query 823 -> 1,998 of 2,052 (40K); 118K prompt, 8 notes to list in order: 0-1/8 placed right in 5 of 5 runs without it, 8/8 in 7 of 7 with it; no speed cost |
| dense overlay v2: Unsloth's bits for the tensors GSQ-RCO cut to 2 bits | `scripts/b70/build-overlay.sh` | natural-text NLL -0.034 (about 10x the run spread) |

Every change is off by default in the patched ggml tree and checked with `test-backend-ops`; the details and the
rejected alternatives are in [`docs/B70-SYCL.md`](docs/B70-SYCL.md) and [`docs/B70-config.md`](docs/B70-config.md).

## Preferred config

**Overlay v3 with vision**: the heaviest overlay this card runs at a usable speed. It is the validated
configuration below with more bits where the stock quantization is thinnest: expert down and the dense tensors.
Same build, flags and launcher, a different head. It gives up decode speed. Measured against v2 in one session
on the hardware below, two server starts per overlay:

| | v2 (validated config) | v3 (preferred) |
|---|---|---|
| decode, short prompt | 24-32 tok/s | 18-21 tok/s |
| prefill at 20K / 40K / 89K | 514 / 522 / 416-431 tok/s | 454 / 482 / 401-408 tok/s |
| expert blocks resident in VRAM | 67% | 51% |
| 89K needle / 118K prompt, 8 notes recalled | correct / 7 of 8 | correct / 7 of 8 |

**Weights.** v2, plus from Unsloth's UD-Q3_K_XL:
- expert down at IQ4_NL on the 43 layers v2 leaves at Q2_0 (+20.3 GB);
- the attention, shared-expert gate/up and `ssm_out` tensors at Q8_0 instead of Q5_K/Q6_K (+3.0 GB).

Expert gate/up stay Q2_0. Vision is the BF16 `mmproj`. That is 96 GB on disk, or 82 GB after pruning the
14 GB of the stock first shard that v3 shadows (which also retires v1/v2).

Quality: v3's natural-text NLL (1,024 tokens after an 8K prompt) is 1.46-1.49 over six server starts on the
current engine. v2 has not been re-measured since the prefill sparse-attention fix. Before that fix, both overlays'
NLL scattered between starts by more than their difference, so v3's edge over v2 is expected from the bits but not
yet measured.

```sh
scripts/b70/build-overlay.sh <GSQ-RCO dir> <overlay dir> v3
# optional: drop the shadowed tensors from the stock first shard (v1/v2 heads stop working)
python3 tools/overlay/shard_prune.py <overlay dir>/v3 <GSQ-RCO dir>/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-Q2_0-00001-of-00002.gguf pruned.gguf \
  && mv pruned.gguf <GSQ-RCO dir>/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-Q2_0-00001-of-00002.gguf

  scripts/b70/qwfn-b70.sh --mmproj <GSQ-RCO dir>/mmproj-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-BF16.gguf
```

For the fastest decode, use v2 (below).

## Validated run configuration

The configuration every number above was measured with (overlay v2), and the base the preferred config builds on.

**Hardware and system.** Arc Pro B70 (32 GB) on PCIe 3.0 x16, Ryzen 7 5700 (8C/16T), 32 GB RAM, NVMe Gen3 x4;
Linux 7.1 with the xe driver, oneAPI 2026.0, oneDNN built for SYCL. GPU power cap 110 W (140-160 W is ~6% faster).

## Built around the Qwen4 architecture

Qwen3.8-Flash-Next ships the Qwen4-generation design, `qwen4exp` in the GGUF, and the engine is shaped by what that checkpoint actually contains rather than by its parameter count:

- **48 layers, 36 Gated DeltaNet + 12 sparse attention** (every fourth layer), a residual of 4 hyper-connected streams, 512 routed experts with top-10 routing plus one shared expert, a lightning indexer (4 × 128, top-2048) with 4-way pooled keys, and a 51B-parameter per-layer n-gram embedding table (PLE), 28.8 GB on its own.
- **Placement follows the shape.** The dense core (about 5 GB) is resident in VRAM. The routed experts are the only weights that need bandwidth, so they get the three-tier cache. The PLE table stays on the NVMe: a token reads 16 rows of 90 bytes from it (181 µs), so the largest tensor in the file costs no RAM at all.
- **The hybrid layer mix is what makes decode flat.** DeltaNet layers carry a fixed recurrent state and no KV, so their decode graphs reference nothing that changes with position and replay as CUDA graphs; the 12 attention layers select over pooled block keys, so their cost does not grow with context up to the trained 262K.
- **The MoE's routing skew is what makes a small GPU enough.** With 512 fine-grained experts and 10 active, routing is far from uniform, so a VRAM tier of ~2,600–3,900 experts serves 62–77% of lookups at 160K context, and the next layer's routing can be computed a layer early by running its block on the residual stream and prefetched while the current layer runs.
- **The model card is followed** for the thinking template, the tool-call format, mrope for images and the sampling presets; the forward pass is checked node by node against llama.cpp's `qwen4exp`, which matters because this architecture is unusually sensitive to accumulation order.

**What this means for the next Qwen releases.** Every hyper-parameter the engine uses is read from the GGUF metadata (layer count and interval, expert count and top-k, indexer geometry, DeltaNet sizes, PLE geometry, context and rope). Nothing is hard-coded to this checkpoint. A future checkpoint built from the same blocks at a different size (more experts, more layers, a bigger PLE, a longer context) is a metadata change; a new block is a graph change, validated against the reference the same way. What the engine needs from the hardware is set by the *active* path per token and by the tiers you can afford, not by the file size: the dense core and the KV/indexer state must fit in VRAM, and everything else streams through cache tiers sized to the GPU and RAM present. The console's cost model does that sizing for whatever machine it finds. Two things are still on the list: the checkpoint's multi-token-prediction head (the *Draft head* setting: the trunk verifies every draft, so the output is its own) pays in chat and in agentic coding but not yet on a 155K-token document, and the tiers have only been measured on the 16 GB / 30 GB reference machine; the console's auto-tune is what carries the sizing to other machines.
