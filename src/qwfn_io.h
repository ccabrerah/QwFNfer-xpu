// io_uring read engine.
//
// This exists because the measured bottleneck on the target machine is not
// bandwidth but *granularity*. Demand-paging the expert weights through mmap
// yields 4.4 KiB average reads at queue depth ~4 and tops out near 0.30 GB/s.
// The same NVMe sustains 7.0 GB/s when asked for 640 KiB at queue depth 4 --
// which is exactly the size of one expert slice. So: explicit, batched,
// slice-sized, O_DIRECT reads.
//
// O_DIRECT also keeps the kernel page cache out of the way. We manage the RAM
// tier ourselves; letting the page cache mirror it would halve our effective
// capacity on a 30 GB machine.

// measured on 2026-09-09 every expert read of this engine was buffered. The
// layout is therefore 4096 whenever every expert slice stride in the file is a
// page multiple, so the payload sits at a fixed offset per part and the read
// lands in place with no copy (the Q4 file); it is 512 otherwise (the Q3 file:
// IQ3_XXS slices step by 512 mod 4096), and the thread backend then reads a
// page-aligned window into a per-worker bounce buffer and copies the payload
// into the slot -- still a direct read, no page cache. Set by the engine before
